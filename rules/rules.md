## 1. **No hate speech or threats**
Any offensive or derogatory comments, **whether serious or not**, towards race, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, sexuality, disability, economic status, or other backgrounds will not be tolerated __anywhere in the server__. 

## 2. **Heated debates**
Avoid politics. Basic discussion of _relevant_ news is acceptable, but debates should be kept off-server. If you get into a heated argument with another user, please move on with the conversation or move it to DMs.

## 3.  **Follow Discord Terms of Service.**

## 4. **No NSFW content.**
Sexually explicit material, violence, gore, body horror, or otherwise sensitive content or discussion are not allowed. If a topic at hand may violate this rule or make someone uncomfortable, **move it away from the server**. This rule applies everywhere, __**including voice chats.**__

## 5. **Follow RIT’s academic integrity policy and security policies.**
- Do not discuss methods of cheating or stream content that violates the academic integrity policy. 
- Information that is kept behind the student login, such as __floor plans__ and __room numbers__, should NEVER be shared on this server. If this is seen, for the safety of the RIT student body, please let a moderator know and the message will be deleted.
- If you intend to share your class schedule, leave the __classroom numbers__ (three letters/four digits such as RIT-2424) and __class codes __  out of this server for privacy and safety reasons.

## 6. **Substances**
Do not discuss or participate in illegal use of drugs or alcohol. **Do not participate in any chats under the influence**. Public Safety can be contacted at any time in response to this by **anyone in the server.**

## 7. **Support**
It's important to reach out for help. As much as we're willing to discuss issues of a serious nature, please do so with caution and direct __potentially triggering topics__ to DMs or a private conversation. Please add a spoiler to messages or media that might need a heads up before viewing. 

# __Where does this apply?__
Everywhere in the server **including voice chats**.

## __To summarize:__
* Be civil. If you would not say it on campus, if it negatively affects someone, if it goes against university policies, don't say it here. 
* Remember, this server is public and heavily associated with RIT. **Your activity here makes impressions on hundreds**. Don’t say things here that would make someone else uncomfortable.

## ⟶ __How we'll deal with things__

Server management will delete messages and warn members, either through a bot or verbal warnings in chat. If necessary, you will be muted until the issue is discussed among server management. **Responses may include the following:**

* 10 minute mute
* 30 minute mute
* 12 hour mute
* 24 hour ban
* Permanent ban

In the event that a severe offense needs to be discussed within server management, a mute will be issued until a decision is made.

**You have every right to open a ticket or submit an appeal to discuss an issue with a moderation decision.** Please don't discuss these issues in DMs of server management members or in the public chats. Instead, create a ticket down below to open a chat with server management, or submit an appeal to discuss the issue.

Remember, these rules and guidelines aren't intended as punishment, but are here to keep our community safe and **comfortable for *everyone.***
