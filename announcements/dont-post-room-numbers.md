# Please do not post room numbers here.
As a reminder, this server is not private - it is a public server with over 800 people, **accessible by anyone.** Your room number is essentially your address for the year, and should *not* be publicly accessible. 
## Additionally, floor plans should not be posted to this server.
Floor plans are kept behind secure logins for the safety of the student body, and their protection is enforced by RIT staff.

Any messages containing room numbers or floor plans will be deleted and members will be warned - please report this if you see it. We will be adding these to the rules shortly.
