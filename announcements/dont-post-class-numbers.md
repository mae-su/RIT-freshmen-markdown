Hey @freshmen, another quick announcement as we get closer and closer to the start of school and schedules start to be finalized. Similar to how we do not want dorm room numbers to be shared for privacy and security reasons,

## Please do not share classroom numbers, such as RIT-1234, or class codes, like 11898.

We understand that a lot of draft schedules have already been sent out, but from now onwards, **especially the finalized schedules**, keep the aforementioned sensitive info out. Any messages found hereafter containing this info will be deleted and you will be given a reminder.  

**Class names** and **times** are still okay, and can still be used to find fellow classmates. ⁠rules will be updated soon to reflect this change, too. 

As always, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to create a ticket in ⁠rules and we'll get right to ya.
