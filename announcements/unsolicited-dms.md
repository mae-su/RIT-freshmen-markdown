@everyone After multiple incidents and complaints of the same nature as well as past incidents, we want to remind you that this is a **public server** and most people here only know each other from online usernames. __*Please read closely.*__

## Over 500 people visit this server __per day__. Respect peoples' privacy.
It is not your responsibility to reveal information about other members of the server. **Everything you say here can be viewed by anyone who joins, RIT student or not.**

**Do not ping people and say "I see you" or anything to that effect.** Do not ask people for their location here, and don't reveal peoples' current or past locations on their behalf. It's creepy and uncomfortable. If you aren't comfortable going up and saying hi to someone in person, **saying it in the discord is not the next option**. This also goes for your own personal safety.

Don't post anything you wouldn't want your professors, future employers, or RIT administration to see.

Lastly, if you see an emergency or incident on campus that does not involve you or the general public safety of RIT, **do NOT post images of it here, or raise speculation events that are not meant to be publicly disclosed.**


If you ever feel unsafe, threatened, or uncomfortable on campus, [contact public safety.](https://www.rit.edu/publicsafety/)
