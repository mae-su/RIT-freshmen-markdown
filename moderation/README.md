# Moderation Guidelines
Along with the rules they correspond to, this folder includes guidelines we used to run the server such as **announcement standards**, **moderation protocols** including decision trees and steps to take action, and **discord markdown guidelines.** 

All markdown in this folder was not formatted for the public eye, but rather as a solid reference for onboarding moderation members.
