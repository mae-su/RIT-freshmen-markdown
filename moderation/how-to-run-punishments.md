# __how to run punishments:__ 
*if this is not consistently followed, situations can quickly escalate.*

BEFORE running any moderation action, please triple check the server's moderation flowcharts.
## do your best to maintain your anonymity.
make sure that moderation actions don't reveal who you are in risky situations. double check that punishment reasons follow standards (see below). 

## __always run mutes, warns, kicks, bans through dyno__, NOT default discord commands 
(*THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR*) double check that you're running the right slash command **before** hitting enter. Dyno allows us to log moderation actions per user and better manage them. Discord is fairly limited on options and doesn't log things per user easily.


## punishment reasons should:
- be **brief**, **concise**, **on point** (1 to 4 sentences max)
- be easy to comprehend
- **cite the rule** that was violated
- are gramatically correct, punctuated, don't show a typing pattern that reveals the author.
- gramatically match reason formatting:
### __what the person in question will see__
dyno formats warn and mute reasons as such:
> You were warned in **RIT Freshmen 23-24** for `<your reason here`>.

For example:
> You were warned in **RIT Freshmen 23-24** `making a harassing comment in #general (Rule 1)`.
