### ‚ü∂ keeping #announcements clean and relevant helps important information get across better.

# __how to make an announcement:__ please consult mod chat first :)
usually, we have someone propose what needs to be announced and have someone else verify that the formatting, wording, and grammar looks good before we send announcements out. we want to avoid plain text and have consistent formatting to keep things organized.

## __scale of an announcement__
- when you send out an announcement with the announcements ping, you're sending a notification to __over 400 different people!!__ 
- for @ everyone, that's __over a thousand__. think about all those phones lighting up with the notification. (one time i saw that in person when sending out an @ everyone and everyone's screens lit up, scary asf lmao)

**TLDR**: what's announced goes out to lots of people! sending announcements isn't too daunting a task, just make sure if you do it's concise, to the point, warranted, and agreed upon. 

- **neverrrrrr** ping @ everyone or @ rit announcements without discussing. especially @ everyone, we only use that for extremely urgent matters
- **anyone and everyone can see things posted in #announcements**, which is why we're very cautious with wording about verification and current events there. don't discuss information that isn't meant to be public.

## risky pings
for risky pings, such as "@rit announcements", we purposefully include a space in the name to make it harder to ping by accident. to mention that role, you'd instead need to type "@ritannou" (no spaces) and let discord autocomplete it for you.
## keep accessibility in mind.
if we make an announcement with an image, the image should ideally have **alt text** for folks who use screen readers.

## __**RIT has information policies**__ 
this is a big one that's super easy but *__very important to follow__*: if something is locked behind an RIT login, we as students aren't allowed to reveal that non-public information in public spaces outside of their system. instead, consider linking to the information locked behind an RIT login
## refer to the markdown cheat sheet!
plain text announcements get disorganized and difficult to read really quickly. don't let weak formatting undermine the message we're trying to send out.
