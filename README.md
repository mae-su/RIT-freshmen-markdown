# RIT Freshmen Resources
A collection of markdown text, notes, guidelines, and more used in the RIT Freshmen Discord server.

This is a Discord server I owned that peaked at around 1050 students in September 2023, grossing almost 500 clicks per day. With that, the resources, rules, and standards we follow are closely geared towards running a large school community server.
 
Feel free to reuse any of the content in this repository, it's here to help your RIT server out :)

### *Every community is different!*
*Always carefully read over things to make sure wording and guidelines match your community's standards and needs.*

### Heads up! All markdown files are formatted using Discord formatting standards.
Underlining will not be previewed through standard markdown previews such as Github.

To paste into Discord, you'll need to click "code" on each markdown file to copy the original Markdown formatting.
